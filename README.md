# Bash DNS Response Tester (Configurable IP)

The dnstest.sh script is very basic Bash utility designed to test the DNS response times of a predefined list of common internet domains. It allows users to specify a DNS server and perform multiple tests to analyze the speed and reliability of DNS queries.


# Flags

Use `--ip-address` flag to specify a DNS server to test from.
Use `--multiple-tests (vaulue)` flag to specify how many tests should be done.
